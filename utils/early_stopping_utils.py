class EarlyStopping:
    """
    Implements early stopping for model training with a minimum improvement tolerance 
    and patience counter.

    This class monitors the validation loss during training and stops the training 
    process if the loss does not improve after a specified number of epochs 
    (`patience`). A minimal improvement threshold (`min_delta`) is also used to 
    prevent stopping for insignificant changes.

    Attributes:
        patience (int): Number of epochs to wait for improvement before stopping.
        min_delta (float): Minimum required change in validation loss to qualify as an improvement.
        best_loss (float): The best (lowest) validation loss observed so far.
        counter (int): Number of consecutive epochs without improvement.
        should_stop (bool): Flag indicating whether training should stop.
        best_state (dict): A copy of the model's best state dictionary (weights) when the best loss was recorded.
